Solution to Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
📝 Problem Description
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

🧠 Implemented Solution
Method 1: For Loop
python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 1000):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        total += i
Method 2: List Comprehension
python
sum(i for i in range(1, 1000) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0)
⚡ Time Complexity
O(n) - where n = 1000

Both methods have linear time complexity and similar performance

🚀 Possible Optimizations
A mathematical approach using arithmetic series formula can achieve O(1) complexity:

Sum of multiples of 3: 3 * (333 * 334 / 2)

Sum of multiples of 5: 5 * (199 * 200 / 2)

Subtract sum of multiples of 15 (to avoid double-counting)

✅ Verification Tests
limit = 10 → result should be 23 ✅

limit = 1000 → final result: 233168 ✅

📊 Performance Notes
Both implementations efficiently solve the problem for the given constraints. The list comprehension method is more Pythonic and concise, while the for loop method may be more readable for beginners. The mathematical approach would be significantly faster for very large values of n.
